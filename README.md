# Post-Divorce-Impact-on-Children-Data-Analysis-Visualization
### A data analysis and visualization on post-divorce impact on children using Python Pandas, Seaborn and Plotly

## Problem Statement

The healthcare research centre aims to explore and understand the psychological effects of parental divorce on children, specifically focusing on emotional stability, academic performance, and overall mental health outcomes. The centre seeks to identify key factors contributing to children’s emotional well-being, whether therapy interventions are effective, and how different post-divorce scenarios (custody arrangements, social support, etc.) impact their development.  
The analysis will help provide evidence-based insights to guide the development of more effective interventions, therapeutic programs, and support structures to mitigate adverse impacts on children affected by parental divorce.

## Business Questions

### Emotional and Psychological Impact
1. **What is the relationship between the child’s emotional stability score and the type of custody arrangement (e.g., joint, mother, father, foster care)?**
   - **Goal:** Determine if the type of custody arrangement has a direct correlation with a child's emotional stability.
   
2. **How do depression and anxiety levels correlate with emotional stability scores in children after parental divorce?**
   - **Goal:** Understand how mental health factors such as depression and anxiety are influencing emotional stability in children.
   
3. **How does the child’s self-reported happiness score correlate with therapy receipt and type (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs. Family Therapy)?**
   - **Goal:** Evaluate the effectiveness of different therapy types in improving a child’s perceived happiness and emotional well-being.
   
4. **Does the availability of peer support positively impact the child’s emotional stability and academic performance?**
   - **Goal:** Investigate whether having peer support networks helps improve emotional resilience and academic performance.

### Academic Performance
5. **How does a child’s academic performance relate to their emotional stability and therapy received?**
   - **Goal:** Assess whether emotional stability, therapy, or both influence the academic outcomes in children after divorce.
   
6. **What is the impact of parental income level on a child’s academic performance post-divorce?**
   - **Goal:** Explore if socioeconomic status influences academic outcomes for children of divorced parents.
   
7. **Do children living with one parent (vs. foster care) perform better academically?**
   - **Goal:** Compare academic performance based on post-divorce living arrangements to see if children fare better living with their biological parents or in foster care.

### Social Trust and Future Relationships
8. **How does the child’s reported level of social trust relate to their relationship difficulties as an adult?**
   - **Goal:** Determine if trust issues arising from parental divorce affect future relationships and emotional stability.
   
9. **What is the correlation between a child’s reported relationship difficulty and factors like therapy received, post-divorce residency, and parental income level?**
   - **Goal:** Identify key contributing factors to future relationship challenges in children of divorced parents.

### Health and Support Systems
10. **How does the availability of health insurance impact the child’s access to mental health care and therapy after divorce?**
    - **Goal:** Investigate whether having health insurance increases access to therapeutic interventions and improves emotional stability.
   
11. **Is there a correlation between the child joining a support group and their mental health outcomes (e.g., reduced depression/anxiety levels)?**
    - **Goal:** Assess whether joining support groups provides relief and improves mental health outcomes.

### Post-Divorce Residencies and Custody Types
12. **How do different post-divorce residencies (Mother, Father, Foster Care) influence the child’s emotional stability and happiness?**
    - **Goal:** Examine if the child’s living situation post-divorce affects their emotional well-being and happiness.

### Effectiveness of Interventions
13. **Does therapy, in combination with other factors like peer support and post-divorce residency, lead to improved emotional stability in children?**
    - **Goal:** Assess whether therapy, combined with factors like peer support and residency, can significantly reduce emotional distress in children.
