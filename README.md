# Post-Divorce-Impact-on-Children-Data-Analysis-Visualization
### A data analysis and visualization on post-divorce impact on children using Python Pandas, Seaborn and Plotly

**Problem Statement:** 

The healthcare research centre aims to explore and understand the psychological effects of parental divorce on children, specifically focusing on emotional stability, academic performance, and overall mental health outcomes. The centre seeks to identify key factors contributing to childrenâ€™s emotional well-being, whether therapy interventions are effective, and how different post-divorce scenarios (custody arrangements, social support, etc.) impact their development.

The analysis will help provide evidence-based insights to guide the development of more effective interventions, therapeutic programs, and support structures to mitigate adverse impacts on children affected by parental divorce.
